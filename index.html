				<h2>What is it React?</h2>

				<section data-transition="concave" data-auto-animate>
					<p>React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:
					</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
							...
						  }
							</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave" data-auto-animate>
					<p>Here, ShoppingList is a React component class, or React component type. A component takes in
						parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display
						via the render method.</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
							...
						  }
							</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave" data-auto-animate>
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the
						screen. React takes the
						description and displays the result. In particular, render returns a React element, which is a
						lightweight description of what to render.</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
							render() {
							 ...
							}
						  }
							</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave" data-auto-animate>
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">Most React developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes
						these structures easier to write. The 'div' syntax is transformed at build time to
						React.createElement('div').</p>
					<pre data-id="code"><code data-line-numbers class="hljs" data-trim>
						class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
							render() {
							  return (
								<div className="shopping-list">
								  <h1>Список покупок для {this.props.name}</h1>
								  <ul>
									<li>Instagram</li>
									<li>WhatsApp</li>
									<li>Oculus</li>
								  </ul>
								</div>
							  );
							}
						  }
							</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">The ShoppingList component above only renders built-in DOM components
					like 'div' and 'li'. But you can compose and render custom React components too. For example, we can
					now refer to the whole shopping list by writing
					'ShoppingList' Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows
					you to build complex UIs from simple components.

				<h2>React Features</h2>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h3>JSX</h3>
					JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a JavaScript syntax extension. Its an XML or HTML like syntax
					used by ReactJS. This syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of React Framework. It extends the
					ES6 so that HTML like text can co-exist with JavaScript react code. It is not necessary to use JSX,
					but it is recommended to use in ReactJS.
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h3>Components</h3>
					ReactJS is all about components. ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, and each
					component has its own logic and controls. These components can be reusable which help you to
					maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h3>One-way Data Binding</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">ReactJS is designed in such a manner that follows unidirectional data
						flow or one-way data binding.
						The benefits of one-way data binding give you better control throughout the application. If the
						data
						flow is in another direction, then it requires additional features. It is because components are
						supposed to be immutable and the data within them cannot be changed. Flux is a pattern that
						helps to
						keep your data unidirectional. This makes the application more flexible that leads to increase
						efficiency.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Virtual DOM</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 30px;">	A virtual DOM object is a representation of the original DOM object. It works like a one-way data
					binding. Whenever any modifications happen in the web application, the entire UI is re-rendered in
					virtual DOM representation. Then it checks the difference between the previous DOM representation
					and new DOM. Once it has done, the real DOM will update only the things that have actually changed.
					This makes the application faster, and there is no wastage of memory.</p>
				</section>

			<section data-transition="zoom"><h2>Advantages</h2>
				<section>
					<h4>1. Easy to Use.</h4>
				
					<img src="./examples/assets/easy_simple_pixel-hand_computer-pointer-100770206-large.jpg"
						width="300px" alt="">
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">As a JavaScript developer, you will easily understand the basics of
					React. And in just a few
					days you can start developing your first application.</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
				<h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">2. Supports Reusable Java Component</h4>
					
					<img src="./examples/assets/React-components-blog-image.jpg" width="300px" alt="">
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					React allows you to reuse components that have been developed in other applications that use the
					same function. The reusability of the component is a clear benefit to developers.
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h4>3. Simple Writing Components</h4>
				
					<img src="./examples/assets/UI-Tree.png" alt="">
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">
						The React component is easier to create because it uses JSX, an optional JavaScript syntax extension
						that allows you to combine HTML with JavaScript.
	
						JSX is a great blend of JavaScript and HTML. It makes the whole process of writing the structure of
						the site easier to understand. In addition, the extension also makes it much easier to render
						multiple functions.
	
						While JSX may not be the most popular syntax extension, it has proven to be effective when
						developing custom components or large applications.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h4>4. Better Performance with Virtual DOM</h4>
					
					<img src="./examples/assets/articleocw-56bba37e791bc.png" width="300px" alt="">
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">React effectively updates the DOM (Document Object Model) process. As you probably already know,
						this process can cause a lot of frustration when developing web applications. Fortunately, React
						uses virtual DOMs, so you can avoid a lot of problems.
	
						The tool allows you to create virtual DOMs and place them in memory. As a result, every time there
						is a change in the real DOM, the virtual one changes immediately.
	
						This system will prevent the actual DOM from forcing constant updates. As a result, the speed of
						your application will not suffer.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<h4>5. SEO Friendly</h4>
				
					<img src="./examples/assets/seo.jpg" width="400px" alt="">
				</section>
				<section data-transition="concave">
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">React allows you to create user interfaces that can be accessed from various search engines. This
						feature is a huge benefit because not all JavaScript frameworks are SEO-optimized.
	
						Since React can speed up your application, it can also improve SEO results. Loading speed plays an
						important role in SEO optimization.
	
						However, it's worth noting that React is just a JavaScript library. And therefore he cannot do
						everything himself. You will have to use additional libraries for state management, routing and
						communication.</p>
